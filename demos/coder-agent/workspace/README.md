# Workspace Directory

This directory contains files that the coder agent can read and modify through the MCP filesystem bridge.

## Example Files

- `example.js` - JavaScript file with incomplete implementations for the agent to complete
- `styles.css` - CSS file that might need improvements
- `index.html` - HTML template that could be enhanced

## Test the Coder Agent

Try asking the coder agent to:

1. "Can you implement the calculateFactorial function in example.js?"
2. "Please add the missing methods to the TodoList class"
3. "Create a test file for the example.js functions"
4. "Review the code and suggest improvements"
5. "Add JSDoc comments to all functions"

The agent will use MCP tools to read, analyze, and modify files in this workspace.
