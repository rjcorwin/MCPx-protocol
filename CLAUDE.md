Hi! 

# Task management

Please collab with me on managing tasks in TODO.md. 

1. All TODOs should have a unique ID. 
2. When you finish something on the TODO list, check it off.



# Development

When helping with development, please follow these rules.

1. Always lint and run tests as you change dev files.
2. Use the packages/cli in fifo mode to kick the tires on your changes.
3. ALWAYS BACKGROUND PROCESS PIPING TO A FIFO IN CASE IT BLOCKS. Otherwise you get stuck and we have to restart.
